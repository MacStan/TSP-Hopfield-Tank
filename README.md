# TSP-Hopfield-Tank
Implementation of Hopfield-Tank model for TSP. Project for my University Course.

Current version is not working properly (while it gets seems to get most parts right, may need some fine-tuning).

Based on following article by John J Hopfield and D W Tank:

Mainly equations and constants from 4'th paragraph
