## Theoretical remarks
Implementation of Hopfield-Tank model for TSP. Project for my University Course.

**Current version is not converging to feasible solutions.**
Look up page 16, second paragraph in following paper:

Based on following article by John J Hopfield and D W Tank:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19135224_Neural_Computation_of_Decisions_in_Optimization_Problems
Mainly equations and constants from 4'th paragraph were used.
